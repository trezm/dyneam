== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is in place to stop me from breaking my website - "The white screen of death" =

When you edit a PHP file, before that file is saved to the filesystem it is syntax checked to make sure there isn't something obvious that will break your site.

Every file that you edit is backed up before your first save to the filesystem and then on subsequent saves WPIDE will try and make a backup. It will save a maximum of files for up to 5 days to the server.

As you edit or more specifically save PHP files, in case of a fatal error, the File recovery Wizard will appear and a restore button will display which will allow you to restore the most recent backup.

If your WordPress install is fully functional then you can use the file manager to browse all of your backed up files (/upload/wpide/backups/), if your WordPress install isn't responding then restoring the file directly via FTP/SSH is the only way.

The backed up PHP files cannot be accessed/restored from the web directly without the 40 digit nonce/key so should not pose a security concern.

= Can I override the default file permissions when creating files/directories on the local filesystem =

Yes you can use the below WordPress settings in wp-config.php which will affect files created with WPIDE and files added during the WordPress upgrade process.

define('FS_CHMOD_DIR', (0755 & ~ umask()));
define('FS_CHMOD_FILE', (0644 & ~ umask()));

= I get an error notification on the bottom right saying 'something went wrong, unknown error'. How can I fix this ? =

Some hosts might disable direct access to PHP files which will block the plugin from accessing them.

Some users reported this issue on **Cloudways**, and they were able to fix it by enabling **Direct PHP File Access** under application settings within Cloudways dashboard.

This option might be available on other hosting platforms as well.
